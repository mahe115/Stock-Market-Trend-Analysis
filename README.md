  ![Trend Analysis Over Time](https://github.com/mahe115/Stock-Market-Trend-Analysis/blob/main/Tesla/data%20visualiztion/Screenshot%20(164).png)
   - Both the closing price and the adjusted closing price show a general upward trend from 2010 to 2017, indicating a long-term growth in Tesla's stock value.

2. **Volume Analysis**:
   - Trading volume exhibits significant fluctuations. Peaks in volume often align with major stock price movements, suggesting that high trading activity is associated with price volatility.

3. **Monthly and Quarterly Patterns**:
   - Monthly and quarterly aggregation of closing prices reveal consistent upward trends, with some periods of stabilization or slight decline. Quarterly data smooths out the short-term volatility observed in monthly data.



5. **Price Movement Correlation**:
   - The correlation matrix indicates a very high correlation between opening, high, low, closing, and adjusted closing prices, all close to 1. This suggests that these prices move together closely on a day-to-day basis.

6. **Adjusted Close Discrepancies**:
   - Discrepancies between the adjusted close price and the next day's opening price occur periodically, indicating potential market reactions to after-hours news or corporate actions.

7. **High-Low Spread**:
   - The spread between the daily high and low prices varies significantly, reflecting intraday volatility. Periods of larger spreads align with increased trading activity and price fluctuations.

8. **Volume-Price Correlation**:
   - The correlation between trading volume and daily price changes is 0.075, suggesting a weak positive relationship. This indicates that higher trading volumes are slightly associated with larger price changes but not strongly.

9. **Impact of Corporate Actions**:
   - While specific corporate actions are not listed, the discrepancies identified earlier and periods of high volatility can hint at corporate events such as earnings reports, stock splits, or other significant announcements.

10. **Seasonal Effects**:
    - An analysis of average monthly closing prices reveals some seasonal patterns. For example, certain months like May and September exhibit relatively higher average closing prices, potentially due to market or company-specific factors.
